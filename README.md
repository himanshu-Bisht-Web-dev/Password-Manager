Secure Python Password Manager
This is a simple, secure desktop password manager built with Python and Tkinter. It allows you to securely store your passwords, generate strong new ones, and manage your credentials locally on your Windows machine.

‚ú® Features
Master Password Protection: All your stored passwords are encrypted using a master password that you set on the first launch.

Secure Data Storage: Passwords are encrypted using cryptography.fernet and stored locally in passwords.dat. A separate master_hash.dat file stores a hashed version of your master password along with a salt.

Add/Update Passwords: Easily add new service entries or update existing ones.

Strong Password Generator: Generate highly secure, customizable passwords with options for length and character types (uppercase, lowercase, digits, symbols).

Copy to Clipboard: Securely copy usernames or passwords to your clipboard. For enhanced security, the clipboard content is automatically cleared after a short delay (10 seconds).

Delete Entries: Remove old or unwanted password entries.

Search/Filter: Quickly find specific password entries by typing in the search bar.

Toggle Password Visibility: Show or hide passwords in the input fields and the displayed list for privacy.

User-Friendly GUI: An intuitive graphical interface built with Tkinter.

üîí Important Security Notes
Remember Your Master Password: Your master password is the key to all your encrypted data. If you forget it, your stored passwords cannot be recovered. There is no "reset" function for security reasons.

Protect Your Data Files: The passwords.dat and master_hash.dat files contain your encrypted data. While encrypted, treat these files with care and do not share them.

Local Storage: This password manager stores all data locally on your computer. It does not synchronize with any cloud services.

Educational/Personal Use: This project is designed as an educational demonstration and for personal use. For highly sensitive, enterprise-level password management, consider professional solutions that offer advanced security features like multi-factor authentication, cloud synchronization, and extensive auditing.
